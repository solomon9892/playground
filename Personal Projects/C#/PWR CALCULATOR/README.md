# Power Calculator using C#

I created this power calculator for Motorola Internal use, basically what it does it calculates 
difference between rated power and measured power by using this formula:

P(W) = 1W â‹… 10(P(dBm) / 10) / 1000 = 10((P(dBm)- 30) / 10)

The app simplifies this formula for better and fast answer. One feature is that you can copy, lol.
