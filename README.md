# Welcome To My Playground

Hi my name is Abraham Solomon. I have been in IT industry for more than a year. 
Im capable of doing whatever a junior IT able to do such as, reformating a PC,
troubleshoothing , ram, hard disk .etc. On the other side Im not really good at networking,
but you can expect me setting up IP address, subnet mask, setting up Router intermediate level.

So you have clicked this repository to measure my programming skills right ? If so,
I would like to welcome you to my playground. In here there's two folder currently,
firt one is "CodeXorcism" where I perform my traning by learning new functions/libraries/datatypes, 
the next one is my personal projects where I open publically; both folders you can measure 
my skills.

Next, I will briefly explaining my C++ journey. So it all started back in 2021 for my 
car alarm project. I started programming using Arduino Framework to program my Arduino Uno for my
alarm project. I started with 0 knowledge, and yes Im a self taught C++ programmer. From there, at 
one level I started to show deep interest on C++, so I decided to give it a try by applying jobs 
related C++. 

I would be very happy if i get chance to be a "Software Engineer", also passionate in learning 
new things. Im afraid that I might not able to get the job because of my weakness below:

   -QUALIFICATION NOT MET (DIPLOMA IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING, WITH CGPA 2.79)
   
   -NOT AN ADDMATHS/ENGINEERING MATHS PRO   
   
   -MAY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR CRITICAL PROBLEMS
   

If my weakness doesn't matter, then you can call me for an interview, if I never meet your 
expectations then Im sorry, we both are unlucky. Thank You for your time.
